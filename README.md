Before you Start Coding

Spend time with your groupmates sketching out the website on paper 
and possibly in an online wireframing tool - before you start doing
any coding, have your plans approved by your instructor

Before starting to code, create a very basic Git repo with a 
   README.md file and push it to GitHub

Add your partners as collaborators in this repo

File all of the major and minor tasks as issues against this repo
    and assign them to a group member
Use collaborative software development best practices to complete 
   this project




Site requirements:

At least 4 separate pages 

Use photographs

Use jQuery and JavaScript for interaction 

Should have the option to contact the business using the 
  Mandrill API to send an e-mail to the business owner 

Feel free to get incredibly creative!
